### VoidParam Puzzle

Published in https://isocpp.org/blog/2016/06/voidparam-puzzle2 

In the code:

```C++
template <typename T> void Process(const T& t) {} 

#define PROCESS(x) Process(x)
```

`PROCESS` can be called with any parameter except `void`, for instance code bellow won't compile:

```C++
void GetVoid() {}

PROCESS(GetVoid())
```

What modifications should be made in the implementation of macro `PROCESS` that for all parameters other than `void`, it works as before,
but call `PROCESS(GetVoid())` (as well as `PROCESS(void()))` throws exception that `void` is not allowed as a parameter.
Function `Process` above should remain without modifications.
